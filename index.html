        <summary>Scenario 1: The Suspicious Email</summary>
        <b>Situation:</b>
        <p>
            You receive an email from what appears to be your school’s IT department. 
            The email states that your account will be locked unless you click a link to reset your password immediately. 
            The email address looks almost correct but has a slight misspelling.
        </p>

        <b>Discussion Questions:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>What should you do before clicking the link?</li>
            <li>How can you verify if the email is legitimate?</li>
            <li>Why might hackers want you to act quickly without verifying?</li>
        </ul>
